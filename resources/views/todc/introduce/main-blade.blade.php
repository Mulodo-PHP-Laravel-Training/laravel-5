		<h1>Blade Templates</h1>
		<p>Blade is the simple, yet powerful templating engine provided with
			Laravel. Unlike other popular PHP templating engines, Blade does not
			restrict you from using plain PHP code in your views. All Blade views
			are compiled into plain PHP code and cached until they are modified,
			meaning Blade adds essentially zero overhead to your application.
			Blade view files use the .blade.php file extension and are typically
			stored in the resources/views directory.</p>
