					One of the coolest (arguably the coolest) features of Laravel is
					its
					<code>amazing routing features</code>
					. Coming from
					<code>Codeigniter</code>
					where all routing is done by controller and method names, this was
					a breath of fresh air. I like seeing a top down view of my
					application and where all the pages are, and the routes file is
					like staring down at a roadmap from the clouds.
